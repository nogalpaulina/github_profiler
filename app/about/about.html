			<h1>Github Profiler</h1>
			Github Profiler is a tool that gives the user a new and fun way to browse Github users, their followers, and the technologies they use. The project is a small <a href="https://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> app that makes calls to the <a href="https://api.github.com">Github API</a> for its data. The initial skeleton of the project was generated with <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-seed">angular-seed</a> and is styled with help from the <a href="http://materializecss.com">Materialize</a> CSS framework.
